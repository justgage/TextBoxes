# TextBoxes (ALPHA)

This is a modular way to compose blog posts, webpage, etc, by using block like peices rather than a full microsoft work like editor. Some examples of a "TextBox" would be a Title, a Picture, a Markdown Feild or whatever.

This project is still in alpha and doesn't work... at all.


# Buliding

this project uses Gulp.js so after installing gulp you can simply do:
```
$ gulp
```

and it will build, set up a server at localhost:8000 and will watchify any changes in the source directory. It also uses stylus for the styling which currently doesn't have a gulp task.
